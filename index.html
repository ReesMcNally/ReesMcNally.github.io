      <p>Hi! My name is Rees McNally, and I am experimental physcist. I am currently in the second year of my PhD, working on (and fighting with) ultracold molecules in Proffessor Tanya Zelevinsky's lab. This work is extremely rewarding, I really enjoy working on a very technically challenging experiment (see projects for more details).</p>
      <p>Before I Joined Tanya's group, I worked on atomic clocks under the direction of Proffesor Jun Ye at JILA, in the beautiful town of Boulder Colorado. While in Jun's group, I had the privledge of working on the most accurate clock ever made (as of 4/18/2017 anyways) and it was a really great introduction to precision measurements</p>

<p>Pior to settling on atomic physics, I was lucky enough to work on a large number of projects. These included meaningful contributions to two satellites, and a breif stint as an applied mathematician working on compressed sensing algorithms.</p>

<p>All of these exciting oppurtunities have made me really appreciate how each field can learn others, and I actively try to step out of my own field. There are ttwo many exciting problems out there to focus too much time on just a subset. If anyone has any questions about my past research, fun project ideas, Columbia, the University of Colorado at Boulder, JILA, or anything else feel free to contact me (reeslmcnally@gmail.com).</p>
