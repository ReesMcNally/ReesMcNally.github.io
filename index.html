        <h2>Background</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Hi! My name is Rees McNally and I am a scientist/math geek living in NYC. I am currently working on my PhD in Professor Tanya Zelevinsky's lab, working on (and fighting with) ultracold molecules. We hope to use ultracold molecules to test a wide range of fundamental physics, asking LHC sized questions with table sized experiments. This work is extremely rewarding, and I really enjoy the range of skills I need/learn every day in the lab.</p>
        <p>Before I joined Tanya's group, I worked on atomic clocks under the direction of Professor Jun Ye at JILA, in the beautiful town of Boulder Colorado. While in Jun's group, I had the privilege of working on the most accurate clock ever made (as of 4/18/2017 anyways) and it was a really great introduction to precision measurements. This work has potentially huge applications, enabling GPS with unprecedented accuracy, and resolving millimeter heights difference between clocks (which would be very useful for geology/mineral exploration).</p>

<p>Prior to settling on atomic/molecular physics, I was lucky enough to work on a large number of projects. These included meaningful contributions to two satellites (one which Orbital Science Corporation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_(satellite)">dropped into the ocean</a>, and one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrnMv476BP4">SpaceX launched to the heavens</a>), as well as brief stint as an applied mathematician working on compressed sensing algorithms. While doing this I graduated from CU Boulder with bachelor degrees in engineering physics, applied mathematics, and a minor in electrical engineering.</p>

<p>All of these exciting opportunities have made me really appreciate how each discipline has something unique to offer, and I really try to step out of the confines of any one field whenever I can. There are too many exciting problems out there to focus too much time on just a subset. If you have any questions about my past research, home built electronics packages, Columbia University, the University of Colorado at Boulder, JILA, my award winning Chili-Mac Recipe, or anything else please contact me anytime (reeslmcnally@gmail.com).</p>
