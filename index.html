        <h2>Introduction/Background</h2>
  </div>
 <p>Hi! My name is Rees McNally and I am a scientist/tech enthusiast/math geek living in NYC. I am currently working towards my PhD in Proffessor Tanya Zelevinsky's lab, working on (and fighting against) ultracold molecules. We hope to use ultracold molecules to test a wide range of fundemental physics, asking LHC sized questions with table sized experiments. This work is extremely rewarding, and I really enjoy the range of skills I need/learn every day in the lab.</p>
 <p>Before I Joined Tanya's group, I worked on atomic clocks under the direction of Proffesor Jun Ye at JILA, in the beautiful town of Boulder Colorado. While in Jun's group, I had the privledge of working on the most accurate clock ever made (as of 4/18/2017 anyways) and it was a really great introduction to precision measurements. Though I live in NYC right now, Boulder will always be a special place for me.</p>

<p>Pior to settling on atomic/molecular physics, I was lucky enough to work on a large number of projects. These included meaningful contributions to two satellites (one which Orbital Science Corporation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_(satellite)">Dropped into the Ocean</a>, and one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrnMv476BP4">SpaceX launched to the heavens</a>), as well as brief stint as an applied mathematician working on compressed sensing algorithms. I graduated from CU Boulder with degrees in engineering physics, applied mathematics, and a minor in electrical engineering.</p>

<p>All of these exciting oppurtunities have made me really appreciate how each discpline has a unique skill set, and I actively try to step out of my own field. There are too many exciting problems out there to focus too much time on just a subset. If anyone has any questions about my past research, fun project ideas, Columbia, the University of Colorado at Boulder, JILA, or anything else feel free to contact me (reeslmcnally@gmail.com).</p>
