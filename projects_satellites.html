        <h2>Space Weather: The DANDE Mission</h2>
        </div>
        <p>As is popularly depicted in movies like Gravity, the environment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) can be a violent place. Winds can buffet satellites at hundreds of meters per second, substantially changing orbits, with large financial impact. To help characterize this violent environment, the Drag and Neutral Density Explorer (DANDE, aerospace sure loves their acronyms) was made. A spherical 50 kg satellite, DANDE directly measures the force exerted on it by the atmosphere of space as the thin air very gradually slow its orbit. This mission, launched by SpaceX in 2013, was the first major science project I ever worked on. Over my time with the DANDE program I designed and built the ground support equipment, lead the completion of the electrical power system, oversaw final construction and testing, and served as the student science lead, eventually spear heading its <a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.A33482">first publication.</a>.</p>
